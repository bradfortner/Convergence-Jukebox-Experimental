# Convergence-Jukebox-Experimental

This project contains developing code to be integrated into the Convergence Jukebox project.

* For the most part this code should be working.
* I'm currently merging convergencejukebox.py (from the original Convergence Jukebox) with convergencegui.py and convergenceplayer.py (from Convergence Jukebox 2) into one file.
* The merged file is named convergencejukebox2.py

Some notes:

* See Convergence Jukebox 2 in this repository for more information on this program.
